I have made a project using goibibo airline dataset which contains detailed information about domestic flights in India for the period of July to August 2023.
Columns:
flight_date: The date of the flight in YYYY-MM-DD format.
airline: Name of the airline operating the flight.
flight_num: The flight number.
class: Travel class (e.g., economy, business).
from: Departure city.
dep_time: Scheduled departure time.
to: Arrival city.
arr_time: Scheduled arrival time.
duration: Total duration of the flight in hours and minutes.
price: Ticket price in Indian Rupees (INR).
stops: Number of stops (e.g., non-stop, 1-stop).

I have used SQL and Tableau for analysing the data given.
